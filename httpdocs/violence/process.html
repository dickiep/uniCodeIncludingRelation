<h1>Your Groupâ€™s Task</h1>
<p>Some people are of the opinion that modern games are responsible for much of the violence that we experience in our society.
</p>
<p>Games are now so realistic that when playing games on a computer or console it is blurring the line between reality and escapism.
</p>
<p>This argument does not necessarily mean that there is more violence. We should not therefore jump to conclusions with regard to crimes being related to violence in computer games but instead keep an open mind and examine the facts!
<p>
<p>The Northern Ireland Executive has invited you and your peers to express your opinion on this issue. The site will provide you with relevant electronic resources that should be examined to help you keep an open mind on this issue before making your final decisions. Following collaborative analysis of the resources, you are asked to create a leaflet that will argue for or against this case.</p>
<p>Do computer games encourage violence in society?</p>
<p>Professional leaflets will be forwarded to The Northern Ireland Executive for consultation. To complete the task your group will give a talk to your peers on your findings.</p>
